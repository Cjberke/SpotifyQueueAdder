# SpotifyQueueAdder
A personal project to integrate Spotify API with Google API

## Basic Functionality
The user will intitalize a Google Form which funnels responses to a Google Sheet. Utilizing the Google API, the user can fetch updates to the Google Sheet, take the newest song request, and send it to the Spotify API. The Spotify API will return the Track URI which can then be re-sent to the Spotify API to add to the User's Spotify now-playing Queue.



## Process for Integration

## Updates
As of now, this script only functions with my API. Need to layout process for adding APIs?
